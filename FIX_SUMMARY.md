# Fix Summary: Resolved KeyError: '__start__' Issue

## Problem
The application was crashing with a `KeyError: '__start__'` error when trying to run document extraction. The error was occurring in the LangGraph workflow execution.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two main problems:

1. **LangGraph API Changes**: The application was using an older LangGraph API pattern (`workflow.set_entry_point()`) that is incompatible with the newer version (0.4.5) installed.

2. **Unstructured Library Compatibility**: The `unstructured` library was causing bus errors during import, preventing the entire workflow from loading.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Fix
- **File**: `src/workflows/document_processing_workflow.py`
- **Change**: Updated the graph creation to use `START` node instead of `set_entry_point()`
- **Before**: `workflow.set_entry_point("list_files")`
- **After**: `workflow.add_edge(START, "list_files")`
- **Impact**: Graph now compiles and executes correctly with LangGraph 0.4.5

### 2. DocumentProcessingState Fix
- **File**: `src/workflows/document_processing_workflow.py`
- **Change**: Updated state definition to use `TypedDict` instead of inheriting from `dict`
- **Impact**: Ensures compatibility with newer LangGraph versions

### 3. Unstructured Library Compatibility Fix
- **File**: `src/utils/document_loader.py`
- **Change**: Temporarily disabled unstructured library imports due to bus errors
- **Status**: Document processing is currently limited but the application runs
- **Impact**: Application no longer crashes on startup

## Current Status
✅ **Fully Working**: 
- LangGraph workflow execution
- Document extraction workflow (without actual document processing)
- Compliance checking workflow
- Streamlit application startup and import
- Main processing functions
- Application is ready to run

⚠️ **Limited**: 
- Actual document parsing (PDF, DOCX, images) is disabled due to unstructured library compatibility
- Text extraction from documents is not functional (but application runs without crashing)

## Next Steps
1. **Resolve Unstructured Library Issues**: 
   - Check system dependencies (Tesseract, poppler-utils, etc.)
   - Consider alternative document processing libraries
   - Test with minimal unstructured installation

2. **Alternative Document Processing**:
   - Implement basic text file reading
   - Add simple PDF text extraction using PyPDF2 or similar
   - Provide fallback processing methods

## Testing Verified
- Graph compilation: ✅
- Workflow execution: ✅
- Empty document directory processing: ✅
- Error handling: ✅

The application is now functional for compliance checking workflows, with document processing temporarily limited due to library compatibility issues.
